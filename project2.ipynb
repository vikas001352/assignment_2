    " Python, an iterator is an object that allows you to iterate over a sequence of elements, one at a time, without having to know the underlying structure of the data. Iterators are used to implement iteration in Python and are widely used in loops, such as for loops and while loops.\n",

    "    In Python, a generator function is a special type of function that uses the yield keyword instead of return to return data. When a generator function is called, it returns a generator object, which can be iterated over to produce a sequence of values. Unlike regular functions, generator functions do not execute the whole function body at once. Instead, they execute up to the yield statement, pause, and save their internal state. The next time the generator is called, it resumes execution from where it left off, continuing until it reaches the next yield statement or the end of the function.\n",

    "The yield keyword is used to produce values one at a time, allowing the generator to be memory-efficient and produce an indefinite number of values without storing all the values in memory at once.\n",

    "Benefits of using generator functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory efficiency: Generator functions produce values on-the-fly, so they don't need to store the entire sequence in memory. This is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets or infinite sequences.\n",
